An article page with an editable title.

Since back-end was optional for me, I did front-end part of the exercise.
I also added media queries for mobile layout.

Since I didn't use database, I created an array to save generated slugs, in order
to do functionality of adding random characters to existing titles.

I used SCSS.
In order to make SCSS changes, install dependencies and run a gulp command:
npm install
gulp
